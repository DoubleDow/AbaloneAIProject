# AbaloneAIProject

Hello! I'm Nathan, this is my first real "project" if you can call it one. Really, I wanted to learn how I could try to do machine learning on my machine.

I used an abalone data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, linked https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php.

It was incredibly informative, and I'm ready to learn more soon (once I recover from having to figure out dependencies for many afternoons in a row.)

Contained in the abaloneProjectNotebook.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that splits the data in to a test-train set and makes regresions using linear, polynomial, K nearest neighbors regressor, and a Multilevel Perception with hidden layers. The notebook is annotated mostly, so check it out!
